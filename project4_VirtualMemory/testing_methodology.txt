1) void memoryMaxer(): Provided in the project specification.

2) void testRAM(): This is a basic test that creates 10 pages and then deletes them, to illustrate the working of the 4 api calls create_page, get_value, store_value, and free_page.

3) void testFullMemory(): This is a function that tries to create more than 1000 pages (which is the max amount allowed), and fails appropriately.
